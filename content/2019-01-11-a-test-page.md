Here we are then, a new year, a new blog, a new platform. Yet again I have ignored the good advice to *never write your own CMS* and I've started [this project](https://github.com/rumorsmatrix/blog). It's a simple flat-file, Markdown powered blog, written in PHP.

I'm using it as an excuse to learn about `composer` and doing routing in a proper object-oriented application. It's going pretty well so far, I think.
